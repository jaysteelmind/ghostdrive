What am I pretending not to know?
What do I wish someone would say to me?
What’s the real reason I’m angry lately?
What do I need to forgive myself for?
What have I learned the hard way?
What version of myself am I afraid to become?
Who do I miss but won’t admit it?
What am I still grieving that I pretend I’m not?
What lie have I told so often that I started to believe it?
What do I want to scream but can’t?
